\chapter{Introduction}
Given the report from ACEA \cite{ACEA2021} we can see that the circulating fleets in EU have an average age of 13 years and with a predominance of Diesel powered as we can see in the Figure \ref{fig:hdpower}

%\cite{hdpower}

So in compliance with the sustainability goals given by the UN it is necessary to renew also the Heavy duty compart. To do that we have 3 main options that we present in Table \ref{tab:dieselalternative}

As said in a recent book the Electric batteries for Heay Duty are not so conviniebt so we will focus on the $H_2$ technologies.
