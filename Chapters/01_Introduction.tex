So in compliance with the sustainability goals given by the UN it is necessary to renew also the Heavy duty compart. To do that we have 3 main options:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Biofuels
    \item Electric batteries
    \item $H_2$
\end{itemize}
As said the recent book \cite{Mazzo2021} the Electric batteries for Heay Duty are not so conviniebt so we will focus on the $H_2$ technologies.
