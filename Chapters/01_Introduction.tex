\chapter{Introduction}
Heavy duty transport can be seen as the backbone of today's economy: all commerce, from local retailers to big e-commerce brands, would not be possible without it.
It's one of the most important links of the logistics chain, given that it makes possible to have the capillarity and the short lead times to which we are all used in today's world.
But times like the ones we are living in oblige us to pose an important question: \textbf{\textit{is all this sustainable?}}

Given the report from ACEA\textsuperscript{\cite{ACEA2021}}, we can see that the circulating Heavy Duty fleets in EU have an average age of \textit{\textbf{13 years}}, with a predominance of diesel powered vehicles (Figure \ref{fig:hdpower}).

The goods transportation sector has a predominant weight on the energetic consumption of the European Union; in fact, over 40 % of all the liquid fuels for road use are consumed by this sector\textsuperscript{\cite{}} \textbf{MANCA LA FONTE DEL PNMI}
So, in compliance with the UN sustainable development goals, the  necessity to renew this sector is evident.
How to do this is an interesting question that puts on the table different solutions ranging from Hybrid trucks coupled with overhead contact lines to be powered with when on highways to "simple" battery electric trucks and passing also from H2 solutions.
In Table \ref{tab:dieselalternative} we can find the main options that can help us reach this objective:

\input{Chapters/tables_codes/table_pros_cons}

Regarding the use of batteries, as stated in a recent book by Professor R. Mazzoncini\textsuperscript{\cite{Mazzo2021}}, this is not so convenient, because of their size and type of use; to maintain a range which is compatible with a diesel solution, a BEV will weigh almost \textbf{5 tons }more.
Hence, the focus to produce HD vehicles that are green during use needs to pass from $H_2$ technologies, which will be the focus of this paper.

\section{Sate of the Art}
The field of Hydrogen production is in continuous development.
In the recent years, more and more attention is being put in these technologies, as they can offer a solution to a handful of problems (one being a cleaner solution for transportation sector)
The actual production technologies are the following\textsuperscript{\cite{guanda20211}}:
\begin{description}
    \item[Oil:] hydrogen is produced with steam reforming or partial oxidation from fossil or renewable oils;
    \item[Gas:] natural or bio-gas can be used to produce hydrogen via steam reforming or partial oxidation;
    \item[Algae:] methods for utilising the photo-synthesis for hydrogen production;
    \item[Wood:] pyrolysis technology can be used for deriving hydrogen from biomass;
    \item[Electricity:] water electrolysis using electric power from renewable sources;
    \item[Coal:] with gasification technology hydrogen may be produced from coal;
    \item[Alcohols:] like hydrogen and methanol derived from gas or biomass (rich in hydrogen and may be reformed to hydrogen).
\end{description}

The technology we chose to deepen is Electrolysis, due to the good scalability of the plants, that range from few kW to MW.
Due to the physical and geographical characteristics of Italy and the very virtuous energetic mix, in which almost 40% of electric power comes from renewables, we chose to feed the water electrolysis with renewable energy. 
Namely, the two solutions we considered will be:
\begin{description}
    \item[Hydroelectric plants] 
    \item[Photovoltaic plants] 
\end{description}

Both these solutions also address the problem of being independent from the foreign states; this theme, which is really important, started to spread in the last years in the case of oil and gas.

\subsection{Electrolysis}
With electrolysis water is split in hydrogen and oxygen, in an electrochemical cell.

A distinction can be made  based on the cell's temperature\textsuperscript{\cite{guanda20211}}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Low temperature cells that can be divided into:
    \begin{description}
        \item[Alkaline electrolysis](Figure \ref{fig:alkaline})  based on a liquid solution of $NaOH$ or $KOH$;
        \item[PEM] (Figure \ref{fig:pem}) based on a polymeric electrolyte.
    \end{description}
    \item High temperature cells (such as SOEC).
\end{itemize}

Low temperature cells are already a commercial solution, while high temperature ones are still in development; hence, our focus will be on the former.

    \label{fig:pem}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Hydroelectic energy}
Hydroelectric power plants use the potential energy of water flowing down into the turbine to produce electrical energy. We can find two main configurations\textsuperscript{\cite{lakohydro2010}}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dams with reservoirs (Figure \ref{fig:dam}), that can be classified into:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Small dams;
        \item Large dams;
        \item Pumped storage;
    \end{itemize}
    \item Run-of-the-river.
\end{itemize}

This technology does not produce significant $CO_2$ emissions other than those emitted during the plant construction. 

This technology has also reached a significant degree of maturity: many of the plants that were built in the early decades of the $20^{th}$ century are currently still in operation. This reduces the costs of the facilities, because they consist simply in O$\&$M.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Chapters/Pictures/Damparts.png}

    \label{fig:dam}
\end{figure}

Otherwise hydropower depends on rainfall and a reserve may be needed to compensate for periods of low rainfall. So, it will be possible that climate change influences the efficiency of such technology. We also have to take in account the political, societal and economic risk usual of this type of infrastructures.

\subsection{Photovoltaic}
The goal of a photovoltaic plant is to convert Solar energy into electricity. To do that, a solar cell needs two main mechanisms\textsuperscript{\cite{PV2020}}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the light should be absorbed and electrons and holes should be generated in the conduction and valence band, respectively;
    \item the generated electrons and holes should be separated and transported to their selective contact.
\end{enumerate}


More in detail(Figure \ref{fig:pv}), the light is absorbed in the \textbf{Light Absorbing Layer }(the photon have higher energy of the LAL energy gap) and generate electrons and holes that will diffuse in the layer. 
If an electron reaches the interface between LAL and the Electron Selective Layer (ESL) it is into ESL and can reach the electrode. 
On the opposite , if an electron reaches the LAL and Hole Selective Layer (HSL), the gap prevents the charge transfer and reflect back the electron.

Same thing for holes that are forced to move towards the positive electrode.

\paragraph{technologies}
There are various generations of photovoltaics and we can classify the PV technologies using two categories:
\begin{description}
    \item[Wafer-based cells]  are fabricated on semiconducting wafers and can be handled without an additional substrate, although modules are typically covered with glass for mechanical stability and protection
    \item[Thin-film cells]  consist of semiconducting films deposited onto a glass, plastic, or metal substrate. We can divide them into commercial and emerging thin-film technologies.
\end{description}

We can also say\textsuperscript{\cite{PV2020}} that PV can adapt to the application requests by varying aspect and will spread in different sector but, at the same time, its future is still open for strong innovations with the aims to reach the maximum efficiency of 95\% instead of the present record of $47,1\%$.
