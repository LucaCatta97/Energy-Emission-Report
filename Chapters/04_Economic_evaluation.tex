\chapter{Economic Evaluation}
In this chapter we will provide an economic evaluation of the proposed solutions, focusing on the specific cost in $\frac{euro}{kg_{H_2}}$ and in $\frac{euro}{MJ_{H_2}}$. The cost of the truck has been assumed as an invariant, while the cost of the compressor is included in the cost of compression.

\subsection{Crodo}
\subsection{Trezzo sull'Adda}

\section{Photovoltaic PP}
\subsection{Puglia}
The computation started with the cost of the main facilities such as the photovoltaic pannels, assuming a cost of $1.100$ €/panel and a life time of $20$ years, whose cost per year is $1.159.840$ €/year and $24.023$ € for the tank\textsuperscript{\cite{alibaba.com2021NewAlibaba.com}}.

The total cost of the storage process (compression from $20$ to $300$ bar, then to $700$ bar) were of $10.941$ €/year. 

Due to the transportation of the produced hydrogen it is necessary to take into account the cost of transport of $397.485$ € and the cost related to the emissions that is equal to $53.729$ kg.

The obtained surplus of hydrogen has been sold with revenues of $64.637$ €, computed as the product between the cost of the green $H_2$ on the market ($4$ €/kg\textsuperscript{\cite{Repubblicasauthor2021Lidrogeno2030}} and the total hydrogen that we can sell.

In the end, in table \ref{tab:specificcostpuglia} are shown the cost computations and the specific cost.

The direct use of the hydrogen as an energy carrier, instead of the electricity, avoided the use a BESS and produced a yearly savings of $2.035.465,73$ €.

\subsection{Milano}
The reasoning for this solution is pretty the same as for the Photovoltaic plant in Puglia.

About the cost of main facilities, we had $1.882.155$ € for the PV plant and $86.669$ € for the thank. The revenues from hydrogen was $52.040$ € given the sellable quantity of hydrogen of ($13$ tons).

In this case we there were not transportation cost and the emissions cost and for this the cost decrease. 

In Table \ref{tab:specificcostmilano} the specific cost can been founded.
