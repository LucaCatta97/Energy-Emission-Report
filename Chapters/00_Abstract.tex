\chapter*{Abstract} 
The aim of this project work is to provide an answer to the question:

\textit{Could hydrogen be a good solution for substituting fossil fuels in HD transport?}

This question will be answered analysing a case study related to a logistic depot located in northern Italy.

The first part of the report will be devoted to the description of the state of the art of heavy duty transport, the technologies used and the peculiarities of the current circulating fleet.

The subsequent section consists in the presentation of the current solutions used to exploit hydrogen in the energy and transportation sector.

A technical analysis will then be performed, to assess the possibilities and limits of different alternatives to provide the requested hydrogen to the depot, imagining the building of a local refilling infrastructure to respond to the needs of the vehicles that use the depot as a logistic base.

In the end, all those alternatives will be put to the test through an economical evaluation, using as unit of measure the total funds needed to run the refill facility for a year and the specific cost of $H_2$, also taking into consideration the possible $CO_2$ emissions.

The conclusion will present the results in a composite way, providing also an overview of the possible developments options of the different solutions.
